## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic for this project is opioid and stimulant use. The opioid epidemic is an ongoing crisis in Canada, and many Canadians are affected by it - some because of personal use/experience, and others through the wellbeing of family and friends. Gleaning trends and patterns from raw data has the potential to illuminate risk factors for opioid- and stimulant-related harms. By understanding this issue better, we can inform our research and treatment decisions in the future.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset was collected from the government of Canada, which has many open source datasets. We are using raw data in a .csv file. The information is sourced primarily from hospitalizations, deaths, and emergency services records. The data collected includes demographic information (age, sex, region, etc.) and information about the substance use/harm (medical treatment sought, polysubstance use, etc.). There is information regarding intentional/accidental substance use as well.
