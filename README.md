## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This project will deal with opioid- and stimulant-related harm. As this is a sensitive subject, discretion is advised. The opioid epidemic is especially poignant in Western Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and BC), where there are more opioid poisonings per 100 000 than anywhere else in the country. The opioid epidemic affects marginalised communities disproportionately, but other risk factors can be identified using the selected data. 2020 was the deadliest year yet in British Columbia, with 1716 deaths (an average of 5 per day). We will be reviewing the characteristics of opioid- and stimulant-related harm as recorded in the dataset, looking in particular at risk factors like age, region, and type of substance used. Numerous communities across Canada are affected by the opioid epidemic, and our goal is to identify risk factors associated with various levels of harm. This will equip us to further research risks, to spread awareness, and to assist in destigmatising opioid and stimulant addiction.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset concerns opioid- and stimulant-related harms in Canada, and has been amassed from hospitalisation, death, and medical emergency services records. The federal dataset consists of records from the provincial and territorial offices of Chief Medical Examiners and Chief Coroners. The Canadian Institute of Health Information collected the information provided by provinces and territories and provided the data used for reporting opioid- and stimulant-related poisonings and hospitalizations. The data spans a period of several years (January 1st, 2016 - May 11th, 2021). The dataset includes demographic information for patients affected by opioid- and stimulant-related harms (i.e. age, sex, region) and information about the harm itself (i.e. did the patient require hospitalisation, was there a toxicity death, etc.) The data is sourced from the aforementioned offices (Chief Medical Examiners and Chief Coroners) - most provincial/territorial offices will sort and collect data from medical records, but the data submitted to the Public Health Agency of Canada was curated by officials from these offices.
